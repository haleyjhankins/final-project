        <h2>Comerica Park</h2>
        <h4>2000-Present</h4>
        <p>
          In April of 2000, The Detroit News produced a commemorative section on the Detroit Tigers' first game at their new home, Comerica Park. A quote from the headlining story read as follows:
        "Comerica Park is expected to make the Detroit Tigers part of baseball's nouveau riche..."
        Those who have visited the ballpark agree with the expectations. A carousel. A ferris wheel. A mammoth water feature in center field that can be choreographed to any music. a decade-by-decade pedestrian museum enveloping the main concourse. But wait, there is also a field with a game being played as well. These are but a few examples of what Comerica Park introduced to fans visiting downtown Detroit in the summer of 2000.
        Groundbreaking for the $300 million project took place on October 29, 1997. More than 60 percent of the financing is private, with the rest contributed from public sources. In the time since groundbreaking, the design has continued to evolve. The resulting goal realized is a combination of a classic design for the seating area with amusement and entertainment features that are unique to Comerica Park.

        <h4>1961-1999</h4>
        <h3>Tiger Stadium </h3>
        <p>
          In its last 32 seasons, Tiger Stadium was home to a pair of additional World Series champions in 1968 and 1984. The 1968 club was the first in Tigers history to achieve the two million mark in attendance, and the 1984 club used a 35-5 start out of the gate to attract a club-record 2,704,794 fans. From 1912 to 1999, more than 102 million fans passed through Tiger Stadium's turnstiles.

        <h4>1938-1960</h4>
        <h3>Briggs Stadium </h3>
        <p>
          In 1938, Cherry Street, the northern boundary of the park, was closed, enabling the completion of larger, double-decked stands in left and centerfield that essentially enclosed the park. Renamed Briggs Stadium, seating was enlarged by nearly half to 53,000, giving the facility the basic structure that remained for the next 60 years.
        Also in 1938, the Detroit Lions began a relationship with the stadium, playing their home games at the facility. From 1934 (the beginning of the Lions) through 1937, the football team's home was at the University of Detroit Stadium, a facility that they returned to for one season in 1940. Other than that, each Lions home contest from 1938 through 1974 was played at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull.
        In 1948, a field lighting system was installed, making the stadium the last in the American League to install lights. Then in 1961, when John Fetzer assumed club ownership, the name of the facility was officially changed to Tiger Stadium.

          <h4>1912-1937</h4>
          <h3>Navin Field  </h3>
          <p>
            After three heartbreaking World Series losses, two in a row to Chicago in 1907-08 and to the Pirates in 1909, owner Frank Navin knew it was time for a change. He had seen the fans packed into Pittsburgh's new Forbes Field, and resolved to bring the same first-class stadium to Detroit. Over the winter of 1911, Osborn Engineering Company of Cleveland designed a concrete-and-steel structure that seated 23,000, nearly five times the capacity of Bennett Park. The $300,000 project would have cost about $50 million by today's standards, featuring a giant scoreboard in left field, a relocated home plate that kept batters eyes out of the afternoon sun, and a 125-foot flagpole in center field that would be the tallest obstacle ever built in fair territory in a major league park.

            On April 20, 1912, 26,000 fans crammed into the park for Navin Field's opening day, postponed two days from its planned inaugural date because of rain. On the same day in Boston, brand-new Fenway Park hosted its first contest, as well. Much attention, however, was diverted in newspapers the next morning by news of the sinking of the Titanic.

            The opening of Navin Field in 1912 was widely recognized as the beginning of Tiger Stadium. The changes in 1912, however, were short-lived.

            Over the next 26 years, three more major expansions and renovations changed the look and name of the facility. While the additions were necessary, the original 1912 plans did not anticipate such change, and the facility was challenged to accommodate the dramatic updates to the structure.

            In 1924, the original stands from first-to-third base were double-decked (increasing capacity to 30,000) and a press box was built on the roof. After Navin passed away in 1935, new owner Walter Briggs carried out Navin's wish for further improvements, and an enlarged facility with room for 36,000 was unveiled to the public on Opening Day in 1936.

          <h4>1901-1911</h4>
          <h3>Bennett Park </h3>
          <p>
            The park featured an "L" shaped wooden grandstand with a peaked wooden roof. The position of the diamond was less than desirable for left handed batters, who had to directly face the afternoon sun as the plate occupied what is today the right field corner. Overflow fans from the bleacher-style seats around the infield were permitted to stand behind roped-off areas in the outfield, which caused understandable difficulties for outfielders attempting to spear fly balls. Bennett Park's total area sat on roughly half the acreage of Tiger Stadium. The left field fence bordered the alley along National (now Cochrane) Drive, and a large lumber mill occupied the property that is today Kaline Drive.

            Much to the dismay of the Tigers' management, many fans watched the early Bennett Park games from "wildcat" bleachers, towering, teetering structures that were erected on the surrounding private property and operated by profit-minded locals. The concept started in the 1880s, and the rogue seating structures were actually defended in court by the city. The seats cost five or ten cents, depending on the relative "quality" of location and were often over 50 feet above ground.

            Because of the city's strict "blue laws," baseball in Detroit and many other cities was forbidden on Sundays as ministers expected their congregations to spend Sundays in quiet reflection instead of at rambunctious baseball contests. James D. Burns, the owner that purchased the team from Vanderbeck in 1900, sidestepped the issue by hosting Sunday games on his own property in Springwells Township, just outside Detroit's city limits on Dix between Livernois and Waterman. Rowdy crowds packed the stands at Burns Park's makeshift field, with the first official Sunday game at Bennett Field not to come until 1907.

            Legendary names like Ty Cobb, outfielder "Wahoo Sam" Crawford, Herman "Germany" Schaefer and manager Hughie Jennings piloted the Tigers of the early 20th century to several postseason appearances. Yet while the fervor for Tigers baseball continued to grow, the large, often rowdy crowds found themselves packed into a small stadium that could no longer sustain the wear and tear.
