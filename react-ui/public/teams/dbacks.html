        <h2>Chase Field</h2>
        <p>
          From its signature swimming pool to its retractable roof, Chase Field has become one of the game's most recognizable landmarks. Since the air-conditioned facility first opened its doors to a regular-season game on March 31, 1998, nearly 17.5 million baseball fans have enjoyed the opportunity to watch the Arizona Diamondbacks without worrying about Phoenix's summer heat or monsoon storms.
