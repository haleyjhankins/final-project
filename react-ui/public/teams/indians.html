        <h2>Progressive Field</h2>
        <p>
          Professional baseball in Cleveland is one of the city's oldest traditions, dating back to 1869. There is a passionate connection between the city of Cleveland and the Indians, as they are a study in revival. Both are working, living examples of the power of teamwork, conviction and dedication.
          Historians are certain to identify the year 1994 as a significant time in the renaissance of the city of Cleveland. And it is the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex, consisting of Progressive Field, the home of the Indians, and Quicken Loans Arena, the home of the CAVS, that will be remembered as the crowning jewel in the city's ever-changing urban landscape.
          The Cleveland Indians organization and the Gateway Economic Development Corporation worked closely to fund, design, and build a world-class facility created expressly for baseball, specifically for Cleveland, and most importantly, with the fans' "total experience" in mind.
          Progressive Field is an urban ballpark in the truest sense, both architecturally and aesthetically. Built within the physical boundaries of three main streets in downtown Cleveland (Ontario to the west, Carnegie to the south, and E. 9th Street to the east), Progressive Field offers a fan-friendly facility featuring an intimate environment.
          The seats at Progressive Field are among the most comfortable in the game with more leg room due to wider aisles. In addition, better elevation between rows means clear and unobstructed sight lines to the field. A truly unique feature at Progressive Field is the angled seating sections. Located just beyond the dugouts in both the lower and upper decks, the seats are angled 8 to 12 degrees, offering fans who sit in these sections a view of the middle of the diamond minus the crick in the neck.
