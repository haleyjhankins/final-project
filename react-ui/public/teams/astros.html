        <h2>Minute Maid Park</h2>
        <p>
          Opening in 2000, Minute Maid Park is the third ballpark the Astros have called home. Previously they played at the Astrodome, dubbed as the “Eight Wonder of the World” when it opened in 1965. The Astrodome, a dome multipurpose stadium, allowed Astros fans a way to escape the Summer heat by coming inside to watch baseball. However, by the 1990s the stadium lacked amenities of the new retro ballparks built in baseball: it had an Astroturf field and many of the seats were far away from the field. The Astros struggled to receive support for construction of a new stadium during this time and their future in Houston looked bleak as Astros owner Drayton McLane threatened to sell the club to Bill Collins who would have moved the team to Northern Virginia. In November 1996, voters approved a referendum to provide funding to construct a new ballpark for the Astros in downtown Houston. A 25 acre site in downtown Houston where Union Station, a former rail-passenger terminal, is located, was chosen as the site. Constructed of the steel and concrete with a brick and limestone exterior, construction began on October 30, 1997. The design of the ballpark was greatly influenced by the surrounding neighborhood including the 1911 vintage Union Station that forms the ballpark’s main entrance in left field. In order to continue to provide relief from the extreme heat of Summer, but to also allow for outdoor baseball in the Spring, the ballpark features a retractable roof. Consisting of three panels it can open or close in 20 minutes. The retractable roof also features a 50,000 square foot sliding glass door that opens and closes along with the roof. This provides fans a view of the Houston skyline whether or not the roof is open.

        On April 7, 2000 the Houston Astros played their first game at the ballpark in front of more than 41,000 fans. It was originally known as Enron Field before Enron Corporation went bankrupt. In 2002 the facility was known as Astros Field, then received its current name, Minute Maid Park, when the Minute Maid Company purchased the naming rights. Four levels of green seats extend from the left field foul pole to home plate and around to the right field foul pole. Two levels of seats are located beyond the right field fence. The 54′ x 124′ HD video/scoreboard is located above these seats. Over 2,500 seats, known as the Crawford Boxes jut out into left field, making the distance to it just 315 feet at the left field foul pole. Along with views of downtown Houston, a 57-foot, 24-ton full-size replica of a 19th-century Wild West steam locomotive runs on an 800-foot track located above left field.
